        <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Starting Point</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            After my entire 20 years of life, I found myself lost more than ever. Not only lost in my thoughts, but lost in what others have done and achieved. I’ll be honest that the whole time of my study here, it has been all about fear. Fear that I won’t make the most of my time here. Fear that I won’t be anyone after I graduate. Fear that I won’t get my internship and have to extend my studies and pay beyond what my scholarship paid me, which probably is my biggest fear since my parents are unable to pay me here in the first place.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            Of course I felt something must be done about all of these fears and anxiety, but what is that something? Maybe there needs to be an objective, maybe you need to stop comparing yourself to others, maybe you just need to try hard enough. To a certain extent, these “maybe”s bring a glimpse of hope to me. I said to a certain extent because there really is no guarantee of success. But when we extend it, nothing brings a guarantee of success. Internship won’t guarantee you getting a job, getting a job won’t guarantee you wealth, wealth won’t guarantee you’ll be happy.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            I think at some point someone must’ve lost that “making the most out of …”, but I’ve been abusing that reason to justify my ignorance. Simply saying “I cannot be in two places at once, I can only do one thing at a time, and so tradeoffs must be made within time and location availability in order to do or attend something” is true, but it’s not that you mustn’t do anything because it doesn’t matter. Missing out is normal, because of your physical limit by being constrained in space and time, getting one thing would mean you’ll miss the other. But if you feel like pushing your limit, you must try to do it anyway. You’ll fail miserably, and it’s an impossible task to begin with if we’re talking about the same location and time. But otherwise, everything is doable. You will be tired. Very tired. But I must learn to do whatever it takes for me to succeed.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            Or is it? Maybe it’s just a skill issue. Maybe it’s just a time management issue. Maybe, you just don’t have enough courage. But let me tell you something. Pussing out won’t lead you anywhere. Not doing anything would lead you nowhere. As much as I hate big plans and how quickly they fall all over the place given enough time, I want to rediscover everything. I want to retrace my steps. Maybe doing something would lead me somewhere. What I wanted to build upon myself, is to hate the status quo rather than to fear change.
